### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## BACKSTORY
I got into Software Development right before finishing High School when I knew the career I chose to pursue wasn't for me.

At first it started out with Game Development like most people that wasted a lot of hours gaming. After a couple of months of learning how Game Development works and making a few small games of my own I figured it wasn't a career path I wanted to pursue as well.

Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the **coding** part I just didn't love the design aspect.

After that failed I wanted to try out Web Development. **Low and behold I found what I was looking for**. If I wanted to see how a website's or webapp's layout was structured in HTML or how a certain transition works in CSS I could just right click on said project and Inspect Element would the trick. Halleluyah! Now I don't even need to be a designer and I could just bookmark the URLs for inspiration to use on future projects.

**Now that I've finished College I'm looking for a long term job where I can lend my expertise to my first employer.** 

While I wait for that I continue to learn and improve my programming skills daily.
If this sounds good and you're **hiring**, LET'S CHAT!
